# User Authentication App
 Codespace project using PHP and MySql

## Description

This is a simple user authentication app using object oriented php. This program is light on html use and is a focus on the backend.
The theme of it being a simple library. A user starts with either signing in or signing up.
Signing up allows the user to enter a new username, password and select a role between librarian and member. They can then continue to sign in.
Once at the sign in page, the user has the option of recovering their password as long as they remember their username and role chosen.
Once signed in, members have access to viewing the books at the library, but can only search for books and not authors.
Librarians have more accessibility, allowing them to search for both books and authors. They also have access to the catalogue.
Access to the catalogue allows the librarian to add, edit, and delete any books and authors.
The user can log out at any point.
